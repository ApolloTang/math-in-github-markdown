**vscode** uses [markdown-preview-enhanced](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced) to preview markdown. **markdown-preview-enhanced** by default uses KaTeX as the math rendering engine.  You to choose MathJax as your math rendering engine by adding the following setting in vscode's `settings.json`. 

```
"markdown-preview-enhanced.mathRenderingOption": "MathJax"
```
